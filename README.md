# Skybrud.Forms

*Skybrud.Forms* is a .NET package with various models for describing forms and form fields in a web based context.

## Purpose

At [**@limbo-works**](https://github.com/limbo-works), we're typically building our websites as a SPA (single page application) with a JavaScript based frontend communicating with a backend API. The models in this package serve as a common contract between our backend and frontend to describe forms on our websites.

## Installation

The package is only available via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skybrud.Forms/1.0.0-beta005) - you can install the package in your project using either the .NET CLI:

```
dotnet add package Skybrud.Forms --version 1.0.0-beta005
```

or the NuGet Package Manager:
