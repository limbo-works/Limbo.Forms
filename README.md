# Limbo Forms

*Limbo.Forms* is a .NET package with various models for describing forms and form fields in a web based context.



<br /><br />

## Purpose

At [**@limbo-works**](https://github.com/limbo-works), we're typically building our websites as a SPA (single page application) with a JavaScript based frontend communicating with a backend API. The models in this package serve as a common contract between our backend and frontend to describe forms on our websites.



<br /><br />

The package is only available via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Limbo.Forms/1.0.0) - you can install the package in your project using either the .NET CLI:

```
